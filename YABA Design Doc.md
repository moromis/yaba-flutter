**Brief**  
I want a budgeting application. It should be simple and make it easy for users to add their expenses and income each month and see how it affects their bottom line – how much money they have left over, or will have left over if the month isn’t done yet.

Every month the transactions from the previous month that are marked as recurring or are “frozen” are automatically moved into the current month so the user can quickly see how the month is likely to go

**Features**

- Add a transaction  
- Categorize a transaction  
- Dashboard to see spend in different categories  
- “Freeze” a transaction so that it appears by default month after month  
- Months get frozen after the month is finished, but are still viewable, exportable, and can be compared with other month(s), including the current one  
- Cross platform: Windows, Android, and MacOS  
- Fully tested
